# react-date-selector
This project is a custom mobile-first dark themed calendar style date selector.

While the component was built using a mobile-first philosophy.

The component is verified to work on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Safari Mobile, and Chrome Mobile.
Testing still required for Edge and Android Mobile

Since the date input is entirely custom it was not written in semantic HTML and will require updates to the accessibilty tree.

Making this component fully accessible is the next goal for this project.
